// This header includes GL's and ImGUI's headers to
// simplify usage in simple projects, and also

// Also this can be used for header precompilation (PCH)

// Same kind of header as this one, but for GL 
#include "gl.h"

// Everything ImGUI has to offer is here:
#include "imgui.h"

// And renderer for gluing ImGUI with GL together:
#include "imgui-renderer.h"
#include "ui-window.h"
