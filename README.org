* Compass and straightedge constructor
The name should be pretty self-explanatory.

When you open it, you will, hopefully, see an empty canvas with three buttons in the top left corner:
+ 1 button, called "*Point*", allows you to place points in an arbitrary place on the canvas.
+ 2 button, called "*Compass*", gives you a way to draw circles by specifying its center and radius. If you click on something other than point, the tool will reset itself.
+ 3 button, called "*Line*", allows you to connect any two points. The same way, as compass, you can reset it by clicking on an empty on the canvas.

When you draw place some lines or circles, you will immediately see its intersections with all other shapes.

Even though, there are only three available tools, you can still build pretty complex constructions with it, to give you an example of something arbitrary:

/Beware, its still very early in its development, so expect bugs, inconveniences, etc... (i mean now it doesn't even have a way to hide objects or undo button...) Report bugs if you can, much appreciated./

*I wish you fun construction!*

** Building

*** With nix

If you are using nixos or nix package manager in general --- you are in luck, this package provides convenient flake that should take care of building and running this project properly.
#+begin_src shell
  nix run github:alexpaniman/compass-and-straightedge/v1.1 --impure
#+end_src shell

This one command should do everything from installing dependencies to building and running (God I love nix)... Enjoy! Also, for impurity of this flake blame Nvidia and video drivers in general, not me :)

Should also be noted that you can install and use nix everywhere, not just on nixos, so running script from https://nixos.org/download/ might be a good and simple option to run this project.


*** Prerequisites
You need to have:

+ ~Clang~ 
+ ~CMake~
+ ~glew~
+ ~glfw~

installed on your system.

On ~Arch Linux~ you can install all of them with:
#+begin_src shell
  pacman -Sy --needed cmake ninja clang glew glfw
#+end_src

On ~Ubuntu~ you can install them with:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo apt-get install -y cmake ninja-build clang libglew-dev libglfw3-dev
#+end_src

If you are using other distros, use your package 
manager to look up package names, and install them.

This may or may not work on ~Windows~ or ~MacOS~, but
hasn't been tested on either.


*** Installation
*Clone this repository:*

#+begin_src shell
  git clone git@github.com:alexpaniman/compass-and-straightedge.git
#+end_src

It's not necessary, but I strongly recommend you to checkout latest "tagged" version of this repository as it's known to build well and run at least somewhere (so it's "stable"). No promises about building and running for other versions even under perfect circumstances, haha. 

#+begin_src shell
  git switch --detach v1.1
#+end_src

*Then, create build directory and configure:*

#+begin_src shell
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  # Make sure that you use recent clang!
  # Projects uses some pretty new features.
#+end_src

Optionally you can use ~-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON~ if you
want to import this project with ~clangd~ language server.

And ~-DFORCE_COLORED_OUTPUT=ON~ to get colorful diagnostics with ~Ninja~

Now build and run (you should still be in ~build~ directory):
#+begin_src shell
  ninja
  ./compass-and-straightedge
#+end_src
