* Building

** Prerequisites
You need to have:

+ ~Clang~ 
+ ~CMake~
+ ~glew~
+ ~glfw~

installed on your system.

On ~Arch Linux~ you can install all of them with:
#+begin_src shell
  pacman -S --needed cmake clang glew glfw
#+end_src

If you are using other distros, use your package 
manager to look up package names, and install them.

This may or may not work on ~Windows~ or ~MacOS~, but
hasn't been tested on either.


** Installation
*Clone this repository:*

#+begin_src shell
  git clone git@github.com:alexpaniman/sphere-raycaster.git
#+end_src

*Then, create build directory and configure:*

#+begin_src shell
  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  # Make sure that you use recent clang!
  # Projects uses some pretty new features.
#+end_src

Optionally you can use ~-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON~ if you
want to import this project with ~clangd~ language server.

And ~-DFORCE_COLORED_OUTPUT=ON~ to get colorful diagnostics with ~Ninja~

Now compile and run (you should still in ~build~ directory):
#+begin_src shell
  ninja
  ./compass-and-straightedge
#+end_src
